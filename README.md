# Road Accident Fatalities Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **road accident fatalities** using Tableau
visualizations.\
The dataset includes accident details such as location, weather, road
type, vehicle type, safety measures, speeding, and emergency response
time.\
The goal is to identify **key accident trends, causes, and prevention
strategies** through data storytelling.

## 📝 Problem Statements & Visualizations

1.  **Handling Missing Values (Helmet Used)** → Replace N/A with
    "Unknown"
2.  **Accident Trends Over Time** → Line Chart
3.  **Impact of Weather Conditions** → Heatmap
4.  **Accidents With vs. Without Safety Measures** → Bar Chart
5.  **Fatality Rates by Road Type & Speeding** → Tree Map
6.  **Emergency Response Time Analysis (Parameter Driven)** → Bar Chart
7.  **Tableau Story on Accident Insights** → Multi-point interactive
    story

## 📈 Key Learnings

-   Understood how road type and weather impact accidents.
-   Discovered that safety measures (seat belts, helmets) significantly
    reduce fatalities.
-   Identified speeding as a **major cause of deaths** on highways &
    expressways.
-   Found delayed emergency response linked to **higher fatality
    rates**.
-   Built a **Tableau Story** to communicate insights for policymakers.
