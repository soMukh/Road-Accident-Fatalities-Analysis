# Road Accident Fatalities Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **road accident fatalities** using Tableau
visualizations.\
The dataset includes accident details such as location, weather, road
type, vehicle type, safety measures, speeding, and emergency response
time.\
The goal is to identify **key accident trends, causes, and prevention
strategies** through data storytelling.

## 📈 Key Learnings

-   Understood how road type and weather impact accidents.\
-   Discovered that safety measures (seat belts, helmets) significantly
    reduce fatalities.\
-   Identified speeding as a **major cause of deaths** on highways &
    expressways.\
-   Found delayed emergency response linked to **higher fatality
    rates**.\
-   Built a **Tableau Story** to communicate insights for policymakers.
